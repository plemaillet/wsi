% Overall Document Guidelines: Head
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Overall Document Guidelines: Head}
\label{sec:intro}

Clear document of any fonts other than Times, Arial, and Symbol. The
paper should be formatted using the tags provided in the template,
i.e., title, author, section, subsection, subsubsection, eq./fig.,
references, etc.  in a 2 column format on US letter size paper ($8.5
\times 11$ inches, or $21.6 \times 27.9$ cm).

The left and right margins are set automatically to .75 inch (1.90 cm),
and the top and bottom margins to 1.0 inch (2.54 cm). The document is in
a 2-column format with column widths set at 3.38 inch (8.57 cm) and the
gutter -the space between columns- at .25 inch (0.635 cm).

Papers should be a maximum of 4-6 pages; longer papers will be
returned for revision. Please do not place folios or page numbers in
your paper. That information is inserted when we assemble the book.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Graphics and Equations
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Graphics and Equations}
Graphics and equations should fit within one column (3.38 inches
wide), but full width (7 inch) figures are also acceptable. Equations,
figures and figure captions each have their own style tags. Equations
are numbered using parentheses flushed right as shown below.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ist}
\textrm{IS\&T} + \textrm{members} \times \textrm{Confs.} = \textrm{Success}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Helpful Hints and Style Tags: Subhead}
For a complete listing of the style tags for use in this template
refer to Table \ref{tab:fonts}. These are the style tags for
conference proceedings; if you use the wrong template/style tags your
paper will be sent back to you to be reformatted.  All of these forms
and templates related to the publication of conference papers are
available at

www.imaging.org/conferences/guidelines.cfm. 

Select the specific conference and download the Authors Kit. The
template may vary from one conference to another.

The template is set up for MS Word and LaTeX. Please check the paper
carefully to confirm that the styles have been applied correctly, then
print it out and double check to ensure that the paper appears as
intended.

% Submitting Your Paper

\section{Submitting Your Paper}
The submission of your paper has to be performed through the IS\&T
submission website. Authors receive a login for this site by e-mail.
Papers can be submitted in Postscript, Word, or WordPerfect format,
and will be converted to PDF by the submission server. Please
carefully review the generated PDF and verify that all the text,
equations, figures and tables are displayed correctly before approving
its submission.

\subsection{Margins in LaTeX}
Because of the differences between dvips conversion utilities, the
margins of your generated PDF document might vary. Please print
your document, and verify its margins. If they are incorrect, please
adapt the sizes of the margins in the file \emph{ist.sty}. Typically the
top margin should be decreased.

% Reference Preparation
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Reference Preparation}
Use the standard LaTeX \emph{cite} command for references in the
text. You can then use the standard bibliography command to generate
the list of references. Add the command \emph{small} before the
bibliography to give it the right font size.  Reference \cite{bib1}
style should be used for books, Reference \cite{bib2} style should be
used for Journals, and Reference \cite{bib3} style should be used for
Proceedings.
